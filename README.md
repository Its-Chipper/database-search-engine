Python - database search engine using Tkinter and .txt file

A simple database search engine made with Tkinter in python. Uses the names.txt file for storage of the database and uses a simple structure for storage. Uses the basic inputs in the shell but i am looking in to implementing an input in the Tkinter window. Has four simple functions of searching, editing, adding and deleting entries.
